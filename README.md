# Typescript definitions Webpack loader

A webpack plugin to generate and pack together typescript definitions.

Mostly used when writing a typescript library and want a clean single definition output.

# Usage

You will need to include the following in your webpack config as a loader.

The output query parameter must be set to get the packer running correctly.

We concat all the definitions files in there...

```
module.exports = {
  module: {
    {
      test: /\/.ts$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      loader: 'ts-definitions-webpack-loader?output=dist/a_definition_file.d.ts'
    }
  }
}
